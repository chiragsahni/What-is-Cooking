# What-is-Cooking

# GOAL – To predict the type of cuisine of a recipe/dish on the basis of its ingredients.

## BUSINESS APPLICATIONS / FUTURE SCOPE

This project of What’s Cooking has a very wide scope in the machine learning world and has multiple
business applications in the real world. A business application of this project is that it can be used
by the online food delivery industry to automatically divide a new partner restaurant’s menu
into sub-menus based on different cuisines. Hence, expediting the process of adding a new entity
into the existing system which is almost impossible to do by implementing other technological
assets like a core programming interface.

If we can get an extra feature / field of ‘Calories Contained’ in the recipe added to the dataset, this
project can turn out to be of great utility to the dieticians and nutritionists. For example, a health
consultant can define personalized diet charts for its clients which vary depending on the various
cuisines the client prefers.
